      <p>
        Ever forgotten to water your leafy friends? Bloomi is an Android app
        made to remind you of when to care for your plants! Generating growth
        history graphs and delivering mobile notifications, Bloomi is the
        largest project I had ever taken on by myself. With 6000+ lines of Java
        and XML written over the winter break of my first year, I learned more
        about Object Oriented Programming, databases, multithreading and UX than
        I prepared myself for! This project was a small vision that grew and
        grew with every little success, and I'm proud to say that creating
        Bloomi gave me confidence of my place in tech.
