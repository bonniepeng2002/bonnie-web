        Ever forgotten to water your leafy friends? Bloomi is an Android app
        made to remind you of when to care for your plants! Generating growth
        history graphs and delivering mobile notifications, this solo project
        was inspired by a lovely orchid my friend gifted me, which I was
        determined to take the best possible care of ðŸ’ª

        In the age of a pandemic, limited access to healthcare is our current
        reality. However, it has been the reality of tens of millions before
        COVID-19, and it will continue to be their reality after. 
        <br /><br />
        Introducing Apollo, a solution to this healthcare crisis and your
        virtual nurse. Apollo provides an intuitive interface that listens,
        documents and categorizes your symptoms during interactive virtual
        appointments. Based on these symptom logs, the app can suggest possible
        diagnoses and schedule appointments with a medical professional, if
        necessary. <br /><br />
        This project was made for Hack the North, 2020++!
